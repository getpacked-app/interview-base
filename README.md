# Getpacked Technical Interview
Hi applicantÂ ðŸ‘‹
This project is the starting point for our technical interviews at getpacked. 
Feel free to have a look around. 

Basically, the idea is, that this has the critical infrastructure in place, that we also use for our main project. 

In concrete terms those being: 
1. next.js
2. style jsx for css component styling
2. firebase (especially firestore as database)

To prepare: 
1. please sign up for gitpod and get the project running (should be free)
2. change something for a test and see if the changes are reflected live on gitpod. 
3. if you want to commit something, feel free to fork the project
4. The project has a getpacked project initiationed for firebase. Feel free to change the details for your some of your own ones, to also get admin access to that project. To getting started you only need a free firebase project and firestore initialized. 

If you want to play around in a fork beforehand, feel free to do so. Only be prepared to explain those to us. For the interview nothing more is needed. 

For styling we will use the style jsx module that's built into next.js. (plain css syntax, no sass). 

We love to see Typescript being used during the interview, but we are fine to use js or cast to any for the interview (never in production), as this should be nothing to hold us back for a short interview. 

## Open in Gitpod
For the technical interview, we use gitpod, you can use it for free, it is a web version of vscode and makes it easy to work on the same basis at all times.

## Next.js Boilerplate
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

# The Task
- We will create a next.js application with firebase. 
- Firebase is set up in the project and ready to use. (Firestore only)
- The specific task will be shared at the beginning of the interview.
